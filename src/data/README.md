# Data Structure ideas/thoughts

```
users: [
    'id': [
        'streamId',
    ]
]
```

This would allow for each user Id to have a number of streams associated with it.

I would need to think of a way of handling stream Ids, ideally each stream would have a different ID, and the IDs could be stored in here, but I think that's out of scope probably.
